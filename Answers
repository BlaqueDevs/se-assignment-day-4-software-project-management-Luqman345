3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile: Flexible and fast, works well for projects with changing needs. Disadvantage: Harder to predict exact completion time.

Waterfall: Follows a clear step-by-step process. Good for fixed projects, but not flexible when changes are needed.



4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa?

Agile is better for projects that change often, like app or web development.

Waterfall works better for projects with clear, unchanging goals, like building a house.
